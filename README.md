# ROS2 Examples
# Installation
```
colcon build --symlink-install
ros2 launch controller experiment.launch.py
```

## Prerequisites

You should already have Docker and VSCode with the remote containers plugin installed on your system.

* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [vscode remote containers plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

## Open it in vscode

Now that you've cloned your repo onto your computer, you can open it in VSCode (File->Open Folder). 

When you open it for the first time, you should see a little popup that asks you if you would like to open it in a container.  Say yes!

If you don't see the pop-up, click on the little green square in the bottom left corner, which should bring up the container dialog

In the dialog, select "Remote Containers: Reopen in container"

VSCode will build the dockerfile inside of `.devcontainer` for you.  If you open a terminal inside VSCode (Terminal->New Terminal), you should see that your username has been changed to `ros`, and the bottom left green corner should say "Dev Container"
