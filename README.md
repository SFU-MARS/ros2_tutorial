Example workspace for using ROS2 Humble with navigation 2 installed. 

Initial workspace template is built upon [athackst/vscode_ros2_workspace](https://github.com/athackst/vscode_ros2_workspace)

* An example of a basic publisher and subscriber can be found [here](src/controller/controller/controller.py).
* An example of a basic launch file can be found [here](src/controller/launch/experiment.launch.py)

Note the necessary changes to the default `src/controller/setup.py` file to correctly run the node and launch file.
